This is my task 4 of the given tasks for the Graphic design internship. I made this infographic with the help of Adobe Illustrator and used online resources for vectors and elements. Thank You.

(I was unable to upload the eps file for the same because its size was bigger than 25mb and github wont allow any files above that size)
